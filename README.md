This might sound overwhelming, but if you've gone through the Full Stack course work, supporting the other tracks should be no problem as the content in them come primarily from Full Stack. 

Also, you don't have to memorize these track names. We've set up learn.co/expert-chat so that only questions on supported batches show up there. That being said, there are still some questions that come through that we do not support.

It's also worth noting that we direct some questions that we cannot answer directly. We can escalate questions regarding bugs, billing, admissions, etc... (more on these later!)

## Unsupported Questions

**We do not support questions on student assessments.** If a student asks a question about their assessment, we want to say something like this: "Hey {name}, we can't actually support questions on assessments anymore. If you take a look back at previous labs and have already Googled and you still need a hand, you should reach out to {learn instructor name} at {learn instructor email}. Best of luck with the assessment and I'm sorry we cannot provide more support."

To find out who to refer the student to, check out the [learn-instructors.md](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/learn-expert-learn-instructors) page. If no one is in charge of the section, have them email fullstack@flatironschool.com

## Old Questions

We don’t want the Ask A Question feature to be filled with tons of old questions, so we need to deal with these. **At least once during your shift, go through all Inactive Questions.** If the last student response is listed longer than a day ago (chat will say ‘Yesterday’ or something is greater than 24 hours), then we should be closing it. 

First add a message using this template 

>“Hey {name}, I noticed that you haven’t touched this question in over 24 hours so I’m going to mark it resolved. If you still need a hand, please feel free to open another question!”. 

Once you send this message, mark it resolved. The student will then get a link to the resolved question emailed to them so they’ll get the message and all the other info from the chat!
