# Which Questions Do We Support? 

## Supported Questions

We support questions across many different tracks. 
- Full Stack Web Development (career course)
- Building Responsive Websites with HTML/CSS (certificate course)
- Introduction to Ruby (free course)
- Introduction to Javascript (free course) 
- Ruby: Building Command Line Applications (certificate course)
- Javascript: Building Interactive Websites (certificate course)
- Bootcamp Prep (free course) 

This might sound overwhelming, but if you;ve gone through the Full Stack course work, supporting the other tracks should be no problem as the content in them come primarily from Full Stack. 

## Unsupported Questions

**We do not support questions on student assessments.** If a student asks a question about their assessment, we want to say something like this: "Hey {name}, we can't actually support questions on assessments anymore. If you take a look back at previous labs and have already Googled and you still need a hand, you should reach out to {learn instructor name} at {learn instructor email}. Best of luck with the assessment and I'm sorry we cannot provide more support."

To find out who to refer the student to, check out the [learn-instructors.md](/learn-instructors.md) page. If no one is in charge of the section, have them email fullstack@flatironschool.com

## Old Questions

We don’t want the Ask A Question feature to be filled with tons of old questions, so we need to deal with these. **At least once during your shift, go through all Inactive Questions.** If the last student response is listed longer than a day ago (chat will say ‘Yesterday’ or something is greater than 24 hours), then we should be closing it. 

First add a message using this template 

>“Hey {name}, I noticed that you haven’t touched this question in over 24 hours so I’m going to mark it resolved. If you >still need a hand, please feel free to open another question!”. 

Once you send this message, mark it resolved. The student will then get a link to the resolved question emailed to them so they’ll get the message and all the other info from the chat!
